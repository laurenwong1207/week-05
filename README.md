## Overview
Integrating motion visualization into personal finance applications enhances data engagement and comprehension for users. By depicting spending habits through particle motion, the data transforms into a dynamic representation, enabling users to discern patterns and trends in their spending over time.

## Inspiration
I was inspired by the data visualization done by New York Times, using the motion of particles to show the distribution of two groups across time. The motion of particles captivates audiences and draw them into the data in a visually compelling way. It also enhances clarity by making complex patterns or trends more apparent.
Instead of relying solely on static charts or graphs, motion visualization can provide a more intuitive representation of how data changes over time or across different variables.

I want to incorporating the motion of particles into personal finance applications, changing how users engage with their spending data. Without using static charts and numbers, this approach provides an immersive experience that dynamically illustrates spending habits over time.
